# Design Pattern in JAVA

## Behavioral Patterns

### Template Method
**Template Method**
> The Template Method Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure

> The pattern consists of a template method in the superclass, which contains the algorithm's structure and invokes abstract methods (or hooks) that are implemented by subclasses.

> Hooks are commonly used in design patterns such as the Template Method pattern and the Observer pattern. In the Template Method pattern, hooks are methods in an abstract class that have default implementations, providing extension points for subclasses to customize certain steps of an algorithm. In the Observer pattern, hooks are callback methods that subscribers implement to receive notifications when the state of an object changes.

> It promotes code reuse and helps to maintain a consistent structure across different implementations.
